# Windows Server Enterprise Environment Deployment

## Project Overview

This repository contains the official documentation for our final project in the **Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate (MCSA) Windows Server** track, completed as part of the @Information Technology Institute (ITI) 9-Month Cloud Architecture program.

The project simulates the design and deployment of a complete, multi-site, enterprise-level Windows Server infrastructure. This hands-on experience allowed our team to configure and manage a fully functional network environment from scratch, applying core System Administration concepts.

### Key Objectives Achieved

* Designing a multi-domain enterprise Active Directory (AD) structure.
* Implementing and managing critical network services (DNS, IIS, WSUS).
* Applying security and management policies using Group Policy Objects (GPO).
* Gaining practical experience in enterprise-level server management and troubleshooting.

## Infrastructure and Technologies

The project successfully built and ran a fully functional network (simulating a Wide Area Network) and covered the following technologies and components:

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Active Directory** | Configuration of Root and Child Domains, Users, Groups, Organisational Units (OUs), Permissions, and Roaming Profiles. |
| **DNS** | Primary and Secondary DNS Zone implementation for robust name resolution. |
| **Group Policy (GPO)** | Deployment of Security Policies, Desktop Restrictions, USB Device Blocking, and centralised Software Deployment (e.g., WinRAR). |
| **Web Server (IIS)** | Hosting internal corporate websites with primary and secondary DNS configuration. |
| **Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC)** | Deployment and configuration for enhanced security in remote/less secure sites. |
| **Windows Server Update Services (WSUS)** | Centralized patch management and update distribution control. |
| **Enterprise Management** | Hands-on experience with server management tools, MSI installations, and network infrastructure management. |
